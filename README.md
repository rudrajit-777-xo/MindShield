# 🧠 MindShield AI

### AI-Powered Mental Health Monitoring & Early Risk Detection System

---

## 📌 Overview

**MindShield AI** is an intelligent mental health analysis system that helps users track their thoughts, identify negative thinking patterns, and predict the risk of mental health relapse.

The system combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to analyze user input and provide meaningful insights such as emotional state, cognitive patterns, and relapse risk levels.

## 🚀 Key Features

### ✍️ Thought Journal

* Users can write their daily thoughts
* Entries are stored date-wise
* Calendar-based tracking system

### 📊 Sentiment Analysis

* Uses VADER (NLTK)
* Detects emotional tone:

  * Positive
  * Negative
  * Neutral

### 🧠 Cognitive Pattern Detection

* Identifies negative thinking patterns such as:

  * Always thinking negative
  * Expecting the worst
  * Blaming yourself
  * Assuming others think badly
  * All or nothing thinking(Seeing things in extremes only — either 100% good or 100% bad)

### ⚠️ Relapse Risk Prediction

* Uses Machine Learning (Random Forest)
* Predicts risk level:

  * 🟢 Low
  * 🟡 Medium
  * 🔴 High

### 📅 Interactive UI

* Built with Streamlit
* Sidebar calendar for tracking entries
* Displays past entries with risk levels
